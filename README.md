# MLforAndroidApps
Machine Learning to actively classify android applications

## Description
Given a PCAP file, this will create feature vectors based on given PCAPs and then will train a decision tree classifier which can classify PCAP files.

The apps are: FruitNinja, GoogleNews, Wikipedia, WeatherChannel, and Youtube. Sample PCAPs generated from the Android VM can be found in the Samples folder at https://github.com/sjcomeau43543/MLforAndroidApps.

## Dependencies
scikit-learn==latest

pyshark==0.3.8

## Usage
To create the features file from the PCAPs run...
`python logFlows.py -d Samples/`

To train and use a model run...
`python classifyFlows.py -t traffic.csv -e SAMPLE.PCAP`
where
` traffic.csv was generated by logFlows.py
  SAMPLE.PCAP is the PCAP you want to classify`
  
## Limitations
The `mean accuracy` will not be accurate if there are no test labels. For example: when giving a pcap file it will assume that the label is `0` rather than a number `1,2,3,4,5` which represent the app names. To get the accuracy we have been giving PCAPS from `Samples/APPNAME/dump.pcap` and then getting the label from the `APPNAME` directory. If you wanted to see accuracy for a specific file you would run `python classifyFlows.py -t traffic.csv -e Samples/FruitNinja/dump_a1.pcap`.
